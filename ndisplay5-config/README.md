The heart of how the multi view system works in Unreal is through a plugin called nDisplay.

##### `Step 1.`\|`BTS`|:small_blue_diamond:

First we need a 3-D representation of our wall in exact dimesions.  Download the static mesh [LSU_LED_Wall.FBX](https://github.com/lsuxrstudio/xrstudioguides/blob/main/files/LSU_LED_Wall.fbx?raw=true).

![download static mesh](images/downloadFBXWall.png)

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 2.`\|`BTS`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

Drag the fbx you downloaded above into the **Stages** folder. Turn off **Generate Missing Collision**  and accept all the other default settings for importing FBXs. Press the **Import All** button to import the static mesh of the LSU LED volume.

![import lsu_led_wall.fbx](images/dragSceenToStage.png)

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 3.`\|`BTS`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

It also imported an unneeded **Material** do you can right click and select **Force Delete**.

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 4.`\|`BTS`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Open up the static mesh and it is an exact replica of our screen.  It contains two sets of UV's.  UV0 is just a 0 to 1 UV with the entire area filed.  The UV1 has our 6 x 14 grid of screens with the exact ratio of the wall.

![wall uv 0](images/uv0.png)
![wall uv1](images/uv1.png)

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 5.`\|`BTS`| :small_orange_diamond:

The only change we need to make to this static mesh is to set **Use Full Precision UVs** to `true`. This uses greater floating point accuracy when calculating the UV's (I believe).

![use full precision UVs](images/fullPrecisionUvs.png)

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 8.`\|`BTS`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

It's useful to note that we have poistioned the pivot of the Wall Mesh exactly 12ft (365.76cm) out from the screen. This pivot represents the origin of our scene as well as our camera tracking.

![pivot point in engine](images/pivotPoint.png)
![00 in stage](images/pivotPoint2.jpg)

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 9.`\|`BTS`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Select the **Stages** folder. Press the green <kbd>Add</kbd> button and add a **nDisplay | nDisplay Config** file to the folder. Call this file `LSUnDisplayConfig`.

![add nDisplay Config to project](images/nDisplayConfig2.png)

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 10.`\|`BTS`| :large_blue_diamond:

Delete the **nDisplayScreen** component as we will not need it.

![delete nDisplayScreen component](images/deleteNDisplayScreen.png)

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 11.`\|`BTS`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

Open up the **LSUnDisplayConfig** file.  Press the green <kbd>Add Component</kbd> button and a **Static Mesh** component and call it `LSU_LED_WALL`.

![add two components icvx camera and static mesh](images/addCamAndStaticMesh.png)

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 12.`\|`BTS`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

Rotate the mesh so it is in the front of the stage.  The letters should be right side up if we are looking at the screen. If you click on the **Default View** you should have the **X** axis (red arrow) pointing at the screen.  In our case we had to rotate the mesh by `90°`.

![rotate mesh to front of room](images/rotateMesh.png)

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 13.`\|`BTS`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:  :small_blue_diamond: 

Now zero out the **Transform | Location** on the static mesh for the screen and the screen does not start on the floor. It is `12.9` cm off of the floor.  We need to adjust the **Transform | Location | Z** (+Z is facing up) by `12.90` units (1 unit is 1 cm in Unreal by default).

![lift the screen off the ground](images/LiftScreen.png)

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 14.`\|`BTS`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:  :small_blue_diamond: 

Since our resolution is less than a 4K screen we can use a single cluster node to power the screen.  Right click on **Cluster** and select **Add New Cluster Node**.

![add new cluster node](images/clusterNode.png)

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 15.`\|`BTS`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: 

You can leave the the node named **Node_0**). Make sure the **Parent** is set **Cluster**. Choose the **QHD (2,560 x 1,440)** Preset. That is the size of the entire frame going from Unreal to the Brompton. The game only uses a part of it as the screens don't have this many pixels. The ROE panels are pixels 176 pixels square per panel. We have a grid of 14 tiles wide by 6 tiles tall, thus giving us a resolution of 2464 x 1056, which nestles into the QHD preset. The **IP** of our main machine is `130.39.93.72`. **Enable Sound** and enable **Full Screen**.  Press the <kbd>Add</kbd> key.

![enter new cluster node settings](images/node0Settings.png)

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 16.`\|`BTS`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond:   :small_blue_diamond: 

Select the **viewport**, likely called `VP_0`, under the Cluster panel. In the Details panel change **View Origin** to `DefaultViewPoint` and **Type** to `Mesh`. Select the `LED_LSU_WALL` mesh. Now the screen is a grid of 6 x 14 monitors that are 176 pixels square.  So our horizontal resolution in the wall is 14 * 176 =  2464 and vertical resolution is 6 * 176 = 1056. So change the **Region | Size** to `2464` by `1056`.

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 17.`\|`BTS`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Press the <kbd>Add +</kbd> component button and add an `ICVFX Camera`. This is now adding an inner frustum camera to the scene. Now you can move the ICVFX camera around and the frustum should move as well.  

![inner frustum](images/gpuSettings.png)

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 18.`\|`BTS`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

 Open up the **Scenes | Main** level. ~~Remove the static mesh of the LED wall and replace it with the~~ Drag and drop the **LSUnDisplayConfig** into the scene. Make sure the **X, Y, Z** are all at `0` as we don't want to alter the ground height and put it in the center of the world for now.  The setup can be moved to wherever in a future level you want to place it.  But we want the **Actor** ground level to be `0`, which is what we calibrated our camera to be starting at on **Z**. 
 
 Add **CineCamera** actor to our **Main** level. Call it `Red Komodo`.

![add cinecamera and lsundisplayconfig to level](images/addCineConfigToLvl.png)

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 19.`\|`BTS`| :large_blue_diamond: :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Place the **Red Komodo** cine camera actor in **World Outliner** as a child of **LSUnDisplayConfig**.  This way when we move the entire panel the cine camera moves with it.  Make sure the **CineCamera** is at `0,0,0` in both **Transform | Locations** and **Transform | Rotation** so we do not offset it.  The position will be given to the camera by the **OptiTrack** system.

![make camera child of nDisplay](images/makeCamChild.png)

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 20.`\|`BTS`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond:

Go to the **LSUnDisplayConfig** and click on the **ICVX Camera** component and set the reference to the above **Red Komodo** camera. Press **Compile** and **Save**.

![assign icvx camera to blueprint](images/assignICVXCam.png)

##### `Step 21.`\|`BTS`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now go to the **Main** level and select the **LSUnDisplayConfig** in game and click on the **ICVFX** camera and make sure the **Red Komodo** is set as the camera there as well (it should have done this at compile time above).

![assign game camera to config file](images/assignActorInConfig.png)

![line2](../images/line2.png)

##### `Step 22.`\|`BTS`| :large_blue_diamond: :large_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

The camera preview frame gets in the way of our scene.  Lets turn this off.  Go to **Edit | Editor Preferences** and go to **Level Editor - Viewports | Look and Feel**  and turn off **Preview Select Cameras**.

![camera preview gets in way of scene](images/turnOffCameraPreview.png)

![line2](../images/line2.png)

Adjust the camera settings.  Our **Red Komodo** has a **Sensor Width** of `27.03` mm, a **Sensor Height** of `14.26` mm when shooting at 6K (6244 x 3250).

It's useful to note that that if the camera is set to UHD (16:9 instead of 17:9) our sensor size is `26.63 x 14.98 mm`. You can use these calculators to determine proportion of the sensor being used for given resolutions: https://www.scantips.com/lights/cropfactor3.html.
  
The current lens on the camera today is a Canon EF 16mm - 35mm 2.8. These values need to change for each lens. It has a **Min Focal Length** of `16.0` mm, a **Max Focal Length** of `35` mm, a **MinFStop** of `2.8`, a **Max FStop** of `22.6` and a **Diaphragm Blade Count** of `8`.
